## History

pypdfium2 is on PyPI since Dec 3, 2021. New versions have been released on a regular basis ever since.

There have been the following version ranges: `0.1 - 0.15`, `1.0 - 1.11`, `2.0 - 2.11`, `3.0 - 3.21.1`.

Entries for releases below version 4 have been removed from the changelog because they were too inconsistent.
